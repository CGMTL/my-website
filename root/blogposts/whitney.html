    <p>Slightly hungover and exhausted from travel is the best way to start any trip, and don't let anyone tell you different. I arrived in Las Vegas early in the afternoon and was greeted by Patrick at the baggage claim. He and Joe picked me up from the airport and we were off to Lone Pine, California. We shared stories to help pass the nearly four hour drive and, of course, we stopped by Death Valley National Park since we were on the way.</p>
    <p>At 282 feet below sea level, Badwater Basin has the record of the lowest point in the U.S. It felt fitting to stop by seeing as we'd soon be at one of the U.S.'s highest points. The car read 116 Â°F when we stepped outside the car, and the heat was pretty overwhelming. It felt like I was stepping into an oven. My eyes began to dry quickly as my entire body was engulfed in heat. We took some photos, mostly to say we were there, and quickly return to the still-running car. We stopped  by a few other sights, notably Artists Palette and Rainbow Canyon. This was pretty good for a side-stop on the main trip.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The rest of the drive passed by quickly, and before I knew it, we were at Lone Pine. The town was small but quaint. It seemed to pride itself on two things: its proximity to the Sierra Nevadas, primarily Mt. Whitney, and its role in early Hollywood. Sitting in a car for hours can really work up the appetite. We stopped at a local pizza join to catch a meal, and while we were there, we took our first good look at the challenge awaiting us. in the distance. </p>
    <p>We checked into the hostel (after some minor room logistical challenges from management) and got ready for bed. The room was solid and I had no real complaints other than a clogged shower drain. Oh well. I knew my lodging was about to take a nosedive in terms of comfort anyway.</p>
    <p>For breakfast, we stopped by a local cafe and enjoyed a hearty meal with decent coffee. The rest of the morning was spent gathering some last minute supplies. Joe and I waited to purchase crampons and an ice axes until we were sure we would need them. Ultimately, we decided not to. I did however, purchase a jacket from a mountain supply store operated by a friendly man named Blair.</p>
    <p>As the party shopped in his store, we exchanged pleasantries and stories. He even brewed us up a cup of coffee. It was awesome getting to meet him, and I'm glad we stopped by his store. If you're ever in the area, Big Willi Mountaineering will hook you up.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>With the last of our supplies purchased, we enjoyed a scenic drive up to the Whitney Portal campground, sitting pretty at around 8,000 ft of elevation. Once we arrived, we stopped by the Whitney store where Joe spotted Doug Thompson, a true local legend. Owner of the Whitney store, an experienced climber, and accomplished author, Doug Thompson may as well be the human representative of Mt. Whitney. His stories and advice kept us engaged for well over an hour as we learned more about the mountain and its climbers, including one individual who ran up, down, up, and down the mountain in less than a day's time.</p>
    <p>Once our conversation ended, we set up our campsite and embarked on a warm-up hike of sorts. We decided to traverse the first part of the mountaineer's route, a path we would not be taking this trip. It felt nice to get the blood moving, and the path we took had a challenging terrain.</p>
    <p>All in all, we only hiked for a few hours. When we got back to camp, we decided to head back down to Lone Pine for dinner. The drive between the town and Whitney Portal is about 30 minutes, so by the time we got back, it was just about time for bed. Today was rather uneventful, but a great prep day for what was to come.</p>

    <p><u>Tuesday, June 11th, 2024</u></p>
    <p>I slept poorly throughout the night. I woke up angered by this, but the feeling quickly subsided as my excitement grew as I began to wake. We assembled our packs and drove off to the trailhead. As we stood at the start of the trail, ready to begin the trek, we decided to weigh the packs. Patrick had the heaviest at 35 lbs. while Joe had the lightest at 25. I sat comfortably in the middle at 29.</p>
    <p>Not a half mile passes when we make our first stop. Joe forgot his speaker! No problem, we're not that far into the journey, we'll sit tight as Joe returns to grab it. Well, Joe eventually makes it back and we spend about 10 minutes fiddling with the device to get it to work. The effort was well worth it though, at least for the first couple hours before the battery died.</p>
    <p>Spirits were high for the first few miles, and casual conversation as well as some music helped pass the time. We exchanged small talk with a few hikers traveling down, being sure to congratulate those who summited. It was exciting to know that soon enough we would be in their position.</p>
    <p>It wasn't too long before I ran out of water and had my first snack break. I wasn't worried about water during the climb as there were plenty of water sources and Patrick brought his filter. My snack was light, about 1000 calories worth of trail mix. Those simple sugars and delicious fats kept me motivated and ready to push on.</p>

        <figcaption>This was our first stop for a water refill.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Each time we stopped, we took a look at the progress we made and were rewarded with a view, each more spectacular than the last. Each picture we took contains so much detail, and yet the only thing that will get close to capturing the magnificence in its totality is the faulty camera of the mind.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>As the hours marched by, so did we. We reached a valley where we hiked downward into a lush area. We met a few hikers taking breaks and one that said she was having lunch. This gave us pause as reflected on a piece of advice from our sage, Doug Thompson. Once we reached trail camp, there would be no cover and we would be exposed to the blasting furnace of the sun. Our current pace would place us at trail camp well before sunset, so we decided to take an extended lunch once we reached the lake.</p>
    <p>The lake was nice, although a discovery of broken glass on the ground dampened the mood slightly. We found a nice shaded resting spot. Conveniently shaped rocks allowed for a makeshift table and chairs. Joe packed almond butter sandwiches. Between those, the trail mix, and the protein bars, there was plenty to eat. Patrick and Joe took this opportunity for a mid-day nap while I stayed up shooing off chipmunks as they tried to figure out what was in our bags.</p>

        <figcaption>Nothing more peaceful than lunch by a body of water.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Lunch came and went and it was time to push forward. We were in the woods a bit longer as we pushed upward. A large slab of rock overlooking our progress thus far was waiting for us at the treeline. We took some pictures, a go-pro update video, and continued the slow march upward.</p>
    <p>The treeline was apparently also the poopline, since this is where the abandoned wag bags started becoming plentiful. These less-than-pretty landmarks could usually be spotted by the accompanying flies. Gross. </p>
    <p>We trudged forward, stopping for short breaks when needed. As we got closer to the campground, I became less worried about the elevation, at least for today. I did not notice any shortness of breath or slowed movements due to a reduced air pressure. </p>
    <p>Finally, we reached trail camp. The campground was large and plenty of hikers had already made it. Patrick spotted a secluded area across a small body of water.It was late in the day, but the sun was still shining. Our concerns about the heat were founded. I was already warm and getting hotter by the minute. We quickly set up the tent, filtered some water, and made dinner.</p>
    <p>As we were eating, we pointed at the 97 (or so) switchbacks that awaited us the next day. We decided to try to get to bed quickly and wake up early. An early start would be ideal to avoid the heat of the sun for as long we could and to make it back to trail camp with enough time to climb down the mountain. A plan great in theory, but it proved very challenging to fall asleep.</p>
    <p>The general discomfort I felt from a full day's hike, the heat of my own body, the heat radiating off Patrick and Joe, the rough ground I lay on, and the sunlight making its way past the tent, piercing through my eyelids and hitting my cornea made it feel impossible to fall asleep. Thankfully, I suppose I wore myself out quite a bit because I did manage to find sleep. Well, intermittent periods of sleep at least.</p>
    <p><u>Wednesday, June 12th, 2024: Part I</u></p>
    <p>I slept terribly. I woke up every half hour to adjust my sleeping position or move my feet away from the edges of the tent. The final time I woke up, I was alone in the tent. I could hardly leave my sleeping bag I was so cold. My toes in particular felt like icicles sticking out of my feet. In the wee hours of the morning, I was unable to hide the anger I felt after a poor night's sleep and chunks of ice flowing in my bloodstream--I cannot overstate how cold I was. </p>
    <p>Joe let me don his admittedly much warmer sleeping bag as a coat and the team made haste to pack up camp. We left behind non-essentials started up the endless switchbacks. The fresh air filling my lungs felt good--no sense of reduced oxygen. On our way up, we stopped briefly to watch the sunrise. In a journey of fantastic views, this sunrise was challenged only by the summit.</p>
    <figure>

        <figcaption>A calm and cold morning for an eventful day.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>A beautiful view followed by a strenuous back-and-forth up hundreds of feet. Fortunately, I was able to knock out an impressive 150 feet before I plunged my no-longer-waterproof boots into a stream, drenching my socks in water. This did no favors for my already frigid toes, and it would take another hour before I had feeling in them again.</p>
    <p>Other than that, things were going great! We had a great pace and I was feeling excellent in terms of soreness and cardio. Then came the sketchiest section of the climb. A series of poles lined the path but they were in rough shape, to say the least. A sheet of ice, multiple feet thick, covered the path, which narrowed considerably. We watched as others took their time traversing the precarious ledge with ice axes and crampons.</p>
    <p>Patrick was the first of us to go. He left behind his crampons and took his ice axe. Slowly but surely, he made it across. Joe and I split the crampons taking one each. We also took the guard off our hiking poles to create impromptu ice axes. He went first and I followed. </p>
    <p>I've been getting a lot better about my fear of heights, but I'll admit I was pretty terrified. I used my full strength stab the ice and placed each step very carefully. The comfort I felt when I landed back on solid ground was quickly overshadowed by the dread that i would have to venture back down later the same day. No time for that right now though. Onward and upward.</p>

        <figcaption>I assure you I look a lot calmer than I felt.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The rest of the seemingly endless switchbacks weren't too bad. I did, however, run out of water a bit before the crest. Taking another piece of advice Doug gave us, Patrick helped me fill my CamelBak with clean snow. One or two more slightly sketchy areas later, we finally reached the trail crest. Immediately, we were greeted by a piercing wind. It felt great at first, evaporating the sweat I worked up all morning and cooling me off. We moved quickly to avoid getting cold and began the final couple miles. At this height I was feeling the tinge of a headache forming but overall still pretty good.</p>
    <p>At this point in the trail, you enter into the edges of Sequoia National Park and began a brief descent. There is nothing worse during the uphill climb than climbing downhill. Every step eats at your progress and requires one more step just to get back to where you were. In any case, this was a battle of the mind, and I decided to appreciate the break from walking up. It wasn't too long before we began the final ascent to the peak.</p>
    <p>During this portion of the climb, we passed by more hikers (both those climbing up and those climbing down) than any other point during the trip. We leap-frogged with two older gentleman for quite a while, who we learned this Whitney climb was their first and last.</p>
    <p>As the minutes passed and the elevation increased, I was starting to feel worse. Perhaps it was the altitude getting to me, or perhaps it was the start of dehydration. Either way, at about 13,500 feet (the second time we reached this height), I needed to take a break. I needed a moment to catch my breath, sure, but a worse sensation was overtaking me. I tried fighting it as long as I could, but alas, the time for the wag bag had come.</p>
    <p>I'll avoid any details, but I'll say this: the wag-bag process was not so bad. The wag-bag process at 13.5 thousand feet and with a building headache was.</p>
    <p>This was it, we were getting close. The final 1,000 feet required strong conviction. At 14,000 feet, I had a fully developed headache. I ran out of water again, and I filled my CamelBak with another heaping of snow. As we approached the last 500 feet, hikers began congratulating us and telling us we were getting close. It was around this point I noticed that each step moved me forward an inch, and it took a tremendous amount of energy to push forward.</p>
    <p>I'm not aware of the psychology on this, but there is an instant rejuvenation once you get close enough to see the peak. The tiredness and the depleted energy simply disappears. The culmination of months of training and days of hiking lead to this, the highest point in the continental U.S. The geological marker showed 14,508 feet.</p>
    <p>I'm including an image from the summit, but as anyone who has attempted to take a picture of the moon knows, a camera simply won't do it justice. The hard work it takes to reach the summit, the inability to capture the scenery with even the best camera, and the indescribable beauty that takes up every bit of your field of vision is what makes these climbs worth it. I pushed my body and mind harder than I have during any other hike, and that was part of what made the summit so special.</p>

    <p></u>Wednesday, June 12th, 2024: Part II</u></p>
    <p>After we took our photos, messaged our friends, and soaked it all in, we began the descent. During the climb, you ave the goal of summiting to keep you going The moment you're done at the peak, you want nothing more than to get off the mountain. Unfortunately, 11 miles stood between me and an air conditioned car ride to dinner.</p>
    <p>As we began working our way downward, I distinctly remember reflecting on how long the hike down would take, and how I was only at the very start. There was only one way down and nothing I could do would change that. I just had to keep moving forward. Left. Right. Left. Right.</p>
    <p>As we left Sequoia National Park and closed in on that 97 switchbacks, we passed by a father who was some distance behind one of his kids. He asked us if the path got an easier, a question we readily answered no. A bit blunt, but an honest assessment of his situation would require it.</p>
    <p>Traversing the switchbacks grew tiresome as the sun beat down upon us. About halfway through, I ran out of water yet again. This was far from the biggest concern in my mind. That title was reserved for the ice-laden path awaiting me near the base.</p>
    <p>Well, the time had come. We repeated the order for the way down: first Patrick, then Joe, and finally me. The surface was no longer icy enough for us to share the crampons as we did before. In hindisght, perhaps one crampon would have better than none. Like before, I plunged the hiking pole into the ice with full strength and slowly climbed laterally. Things were going...fine...until about midway through. </p>
    <p>My right hand held the poles which were at least a foot deep into the ice, and my left hand was clenched tightly onto chunks of ice for stability. I guess I was clenched a little too tightly since my left hand pulled the chunk loose and I felt my body weight shift back as my feet sank deeper into the snow-ridden path. I felt a ring in my ears and my heart rate double. I was breathing heavily, and I could feel my mouth become a desert completely devoid of any moisture.</p>
    <p>"Calm people live. Tense people die." I actually said this out loud to steady myself and regain composure. I first heard this phrase from Adam Savage telling a story about his brush with death during an underwater stunt scene for MythBusters. I am very glad this phrase stuck in my mind. </p>
    <p>To be honest, I don't remember much after that point until we reached the campground. When we got back to our tent, I was fully dehydrated. I was also hot, and frankly uncomfortable--my socks were soaked and I had just recalled that fact. To say I was not in a good mood would be an understatement. As the saying goes though, misery loves company and Patrick was as miserable as I was, if not slightly more. Joe, apparently in better shape physically and mentally than Patrick or me, kept calm and even filled our water sacks for us.</p>
    <p>A meal and a short break later, we decided we needed to keep moving. The sun was blazing hot and there was no cover anywhere on the campground. We continued our march.</p>
    <p>Some time passed when Patrick informed the group we needed to stop. He, like me, had foolish intentions to bring back an unopened wag bag. And he, like me, reached a point where he simply could hold back no longer. Joe figured the time was right for him too.</p>
    <p>We continued on. I don't think I felt anything moment to moment. We shared laughs or a story here and there, but for the most part we just walked. Landmarks that seemed so consequential before were merely parts of the path now. Hours passed without notice.</p>
    <p>The final three miles were upon us. I could tell Patrick was starting to feel a pretty good amount of pain. I felt mostly fine but my feet were starting to ache from being wet all day. I could feel how pruned they were and I was looking forward more than anything to taking my socks off.</p>
    <p>When we made it back to the alpine limit and left the permit-only zone, I knew we were almost back. But I suppose so did my body as all the muscles in my body began to flare. I started repeating all the mantras I had for the trip: "It's a mindset. One step at a time. Onward and upward."</p>
    <p>The final two miles of the descent were at least 10 miles long. Switchback. Switchback. Switchback. God, it was maddening. A couple groups of hikers passed us by, mentioning how badly they wanted to reach base camp to grab a beer before the store closed. That was our goal too, but I had doubts. Switchback. Switchback. Switchback.</p>
    <p>Finally, and I do stress finally, we reached the home-stretch. It was late. I was tired. My feet felt like cinder blocks. And my legs were eaten alive by the mosquitoes. Just a little bit more effort and we were back. With those final steps, we could officially say we had climbed Mt. Whitney!</p>

        <figcaption>The end to a magnificent climb.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><u>Wednesday, June 12th, 2024: Part III</u></p>
    <p>Patrick dropped his pack and sprinted to the car. Well, he moved as quickly as a man who just hiked for 12 hours could. Joe and I chatted with hikers near the trailhead. Some we had seen during our own hike and others who would be starting theirs soon. One group in particular was preparing to start their climb upon our arrival. They were aiming for a sunrise view from the peak. No idea if they made it, but I sure hope so.</p>
    <p>Once the car rolled up, the first thing I dd was take off my socks and put my slides in their place. My feet had never been so wrinkly. We took our victory picture and began the 30 minute drive to town.</p>
    <p>I was pretty dang hungry as we pulled up to the restaurant. My excitement to eat was challenged by my total inability to move though. Every muscle, even some I didn't know existed, was more sore than they had ever been. I felt like a zombie slowly shuffling towards my next meal. We stumbled into the establishment just before close (a fact we hadn't realized until we were seated), ordered a Sierra Nevada each, and ate a mighty fine dinner.</p>
    <p>Of course the hostel didn't go as smoothly as planned. The good news was the shower drain was fixed. The bad news was our room was moved, a fact we didn't learn until after trying to get into the wrong room. Whatever. When we finally got into the room, I took one of the greatest showers of my life and fell asleep soon after.</p>
    <p><u>Thursday, June 13th, 2024</u></p>
    <p>If you tell people that you climbed the highest peak in the continental U.S. (a statement with one too many stipulations in my book), you come off as braggadocios. But if you have three souvenirs that show people you climbed the highest peak in the continental U.S., you're completely humble. This is a universal truth about any feat, really.</p>
    <p>Most of the remaining time in Lone Pine was spent picking up last-call souvenirs, but of course we ate a hearty victory breakfast from the nearby cafe. With what can be considered by many as a once-in-a-lifetime event behind us, we set forth towards Las Vegas to end our trip.</p>
    <p>If you know us, it shouldn't be a suprise that we stopped yet again in Death Valley. This time, we dropped by the visitors center for park information and history and, you guessed it, more souvenirs. We even had Joe pick up a National Park passport and collect his first cancellation.</p>
    <figure>

        <figcaption>Joe seemed pretty happy to start his NP passport.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Vegas at last. We checked Patrick into his room, a very straightforward process that didn't take us way too long to figure out where to park, and relaxed before Joe and I had to head to the airport. We had a good amount of time to kill, so we walked the strip. I brought along with me a couple of roadies. When in Rome and whatnot.</p>
    <p>It felt good to walk around, and most of the soreness I felt from the previous night was gone. We sat for a while at a casino bar and watched the Stanley Cup Finals while drinking some beer. While there, we developed the idea for potentially accomplishing rim to rim at the Grand Canyon. Will we follow through with this ambitious plan? Only time will tell.</p>
    <p><u>Reflection</u></p>
    <p>Completing this hike was one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. It took a lot of work from all of us and a tremendous amount of tenacity and mental willpower to push through it. I think we were well prepared from a training perspective as well as equipment. Of course, the caveat to this is the lack of ice axe and crampons from Joe and myself. Still, even with the terrifying climb down, I would argue that the lack of those supplies doesn't reflect poorly on our planning as a whole. And as with anything, next time we will be even better.</p>
