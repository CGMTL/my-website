<h2>Mission Report: Mt. Katahdin</h2>
    <p><u>Friday, July 12th</u></p>
    <p>I woke up, still drunk from the night before, a bit past six. I had two things on my mind: (1) I needed to clean my bed desperately, and (2) I needed to pack for Katahdin. The former is a story in its own right, and I didn't act on the latter until five hours later once I had slept a bit longer and stomached a sausage farmer's wrap from Timmy's.</p>
    <p>The climbing party departed 30 minutes past noon with Patrick in the driver's seat and Joe riding shotgun. I was in the back, trying equally to fall asleep as I was not throwing up. Fortunately for me (and the interior of the car. And the other passengers.), the Bimmer was a smooth ride. After four hours of driving and a bag of chips, I felt a little less dead and ready to reach the campground.</p>
    <p>Once we reached camp, we were greeted with about a million and a half mosquitos. The little bastards were relentless and disturbed what would otherwise be a very comfortable night. Nevertheless, we set up tent and left for dinner at the Sawmill Bar and Grill. We arrived shortly before they closed, but they were kind enough to let us in.</p>
    <p>The food was delicious; I had the Log Drive Burger and split nachos with the guys. Classic bar food but it hit the spot. Joe, being the inquisitive person he is, asked the server about the bar's Mile High Club. The deal is that you pay $20 for a shirt, climb Katahdin, take a picture at the summit while wearing the shirt, and return to the pub for a free dinner and second shirt. Easy sell, we were all in.</p>
    <p>Before we could go to bed, Patrick and I still had a matter to take care of. We needed to submit an abstract for a recovered carbon black conference (in Amsterdam!). So, we set up in the car and got typing.</p>

    <p><u>Saturday, July 13th Part I</u></p>
    <p>I slept for what felt like an hour, but was closer to five. We had to wake up early to secure our spot in line for entry into one of the climbing route campgrounds. We arrived at the line close to 4:30AM.  I don't remember much between arriving and being admitted into the park as I was mostly catching up on sleep.</p>
    <p>We wanted to climb the mountain via the Knife Edge route, but a site closure diverted us to the Katahdin stream campground. Less than one minute into the hike, I asked the group if we had a turnaround time. Still riding the high of Whitney, we dismissed a serious discussion of the matter only to be approached by a ranger shortly thereafter who asked us the same question, "What's your turnaround time?" He also instructed us to head back to the car and bring our headlamps.</p>
    <p>So, attempt number two. The first mile went by quickly and everything felt great. A soft ground with minimal incline felt like nothing. The forest was humid and the path started off by following a water stream. No bugs and plenty of shade helped greatly.</p>
    <p>A bridge over a wide part of the stream directly beside a waterfall was a beautiful gateway into a less than beautiful terrain. At this point, the ground became a lot rockier and uneven. Still, the hike was relatively easy, and we were still passing by other hikers. One group of which were visitors from an East Asian country. I can't be sure of which one exactly, but I know it wasn't Japan since they laughed when Joe greeted them with "Konnichiwa!"</p>
    <p>At some point along the trail, we heard voices grow louder until we were eventually passed for the first time by a group of three graduate students from the University of Maine. It wasn't long before we passed by again and retook the lead. We'd leapfrog with this group a few more times before reaching the summit.</p>
    <p>Not long after, we lost track of which way the trail was directing us. We turned right when, as it turns out, we should have turned left. Joe, leading at this point, attempted to jump onto a slanted rock and slipped, falling hard on his hip. Fortunately, he was okay and his mistake served to highlight the spot as dangerous. Thirty seconds letter I slipped in the exact same spot and slammed my knee into the rock. Ouch. One bloody knee later (and a few scratches elsewhere on the legs), and we kept moving forward.</p>
    <p>The rest of the hike through the forest was more of the same. Once we reached the canopy, the rock climbing began and the view became incredible. At this point, the humidity dropped and the air became quite cool. The next half mile or so was a lot of rock climbing that reminded Patrick and myself of our climb up St. Helens.</p>
    <p>There was a flat area that was connected to a plateau closer to the summit by a steep pile of rocks that would require intense bouldering. We stopped here briefly for lunch where I suspect Patrick was shooting up because his energy shot through the roof after that break. While Joe and I were slowing down, fighting to climb up this intense section, Patrick was practically trail running.</p>
    <p>The heavy panting and tense muscles weren't really the issue for me. At this point, I feel rather confident with my ability to push through being physically uncomfortable. Instead, I dealt with a much more serious problem: dehydration. "A 2 liter camelbak and a 750mL water bottle should be plenty for a small hike up the tallest mountain in Maine," I stupidly thought as I didn't fill the second water sack and left it in the car. I was already forcing myself to ration my remaining water before we stopped for lunch, and it was taking a lot of mental power to prevent myself from downing what I had left. Fortunately, I knew I had enough water to get me through the rest of the hike if I rationed it properly.</p>
    <p>A bit away from the plateau, I heard a guy call out from about 10 minutes of progress below, "How's it look up there? Does it get any easier?" This was the same man I passed earlier who looked defeated and was resting on a rock, drenched in sweat. It's tough to be in the position where you have to tell them 'No, it doesn't get easier soon. You still have a while of strenuous effort to go.' The situation reminded me of the climb down Whitney when an out of breath father asked us if it gets easier. I am certain that once you ask that question, you're fighting a losing battle.</p>
    <p>In any case, Joe and I powered through and, despite another slowdown moments before the summit, we finally climbed Mt. Katahdin. Standing just shy of a mile (5267 ft.), the peak offered spectacular views of nearby mountains and lakes. We took a picture with the Sawmill shirts on and sat for about thirty minutes. During this break, we met up with our trail friends from UMaine. We had a nice talk about what we do and exchanged names. Greg, Shill, and Hallie were in the same department, all studying aquatic ecology. At one point, we were on the subject of having to use a wag bag to transport poop down Mt. Whitney, and they mentioned passing by a nice 'present' left by a climber on their way up. Greg patched my leg up (good thing someone's carrying a first aid kit!) and their group left a few minutes before we did.</p>

    <p>We started downhill, away from the extremely packed summit. I had a new sense of life in me! I drank most of my remaining water since the air was cooling and clouds were rolling in blocking the sun (foreshadowing!). The climb from the summit to the rock bouldering was quick and easy. Before the steep descent, we met up once more with the graduate students. We journeyed alongside each other right up until the canopy. Well, there was a brief moment where we traded the group out for a woman who claimed she was hiking Katahdin to get a little 'mom-time' away from the kids--a point she stressed multiple times.</p>
    <p>The bouldering section was more fun on the way down. I moved swiftly and enjoy the puzzle of finding a safe way down. This time around, I saw a pile of flies next to the present the graduate students mentioned they saw on their way up. During this section, we ran into a couple of lone hikers still making their way up. One hiker expressed concern about the clouds moving in. Not knowing what was to come, Joe and I brushed off the concern. Once we made it close to where we had lunch, we realized the sky was getting a lot darker and the clouds more ominous. Right before we were entering into the forest again, it began to rain. It got cold and windy very quickly.</p>

    <p>On the last stretch before the treeline, I turned to Greg and asked them if any of them needed help climbing down a dropping point where there was only a piece of rebar, now getting rained on. He kindly declined the help, and I turned away. I didn't see any of them again. They didn't die of course, or at least I'm pretty sure they didn't. Perhaps we will meet again on another trail, maybe in Acadia National Park.</p>
    <p>Despite heavy rain and loud thunder, the majority of the next mile was a bit forgettable. We moved quickly and I slipped a few times, but I didn't lose focus or feel strained to keep moving. I generally don't have that tough of a time walking down the mountains. I'd like to think it's because I squat frequently and am use to the motion of bending and loading my legs.</p>
    <p>Once we reached the bridge separating the rough, rocky terrain from the smooth, things got even easier. Patrick and I sped through the remainder of the hike. The last 1.1 miles took us maybe 19 minutes. Back at the car, we eagerly awaited for Joe who lagged behind after meeting and talking with some hikers (neither of us were surprised).</p>
    <p>Completely soaked, thirsty, and a little bit tired is how this hike ended. I'm lucky we had extra water in the car. I'm even luckier that there was dry (though not necessarily clean) clothes for me to change into, otherwise the seven hour international drive home would have been a nightmare. But before we could even think about the drive home though, the first order of business was to become inducted into the Mile High Club.</p>

    <p><u>Saturday July 13th, Part II</u></p>
    <p>"Where were you when Trump was shot? I was at the Sawmill Bar and Grill"</p>
    <p>-A conversation overheard between friends in Millinocket, Maine</p>
    <p>The second day at the Sawmill Bar and Grill was even better than the first. We chowed down on more of the nachos from the day before and three large entrees; Joe ordered a personal pizza and Patrick and I each had a taco salad. During our meal, the bar's owner met with us to congratulate us for our climb and inform us we were 'going to be famous.' Normally, an older man telling me this would be a bit of a red flag, but in this situation it was a genuine compliment. He printed our photo, attached our names, and placed it on the wall, forever marking us as some guys who put in a lot of effort for a free meal.</p>
    <p>While stuffing our faces, I glanced to my phone and saw a notification from AP about Trump being escorted from a rally. Weird, but not immediately jarring. Only a couple minutes later when Joe pointed to a TV and asked, "Is that real?" did I remember the story. Their was a surreal atmosphere in the bar for the rest of the meal as we waited for more details to release.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the moment passed and we readied ourselves for the long drive home. I of course made us make one more stop on the way out since I am at my most materialistic when visiting any park. A few souvenirs later and we were on our way.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the trip was mostly spent trying to stay awake so as to keep Joe company while he drove the entire way home. I'll have to thank Joe again because I have seldom experienced such a strong desire to return home paired simultaneously with a complete lack of energy to get home. If it weren't for the fact that Joe is part robot, we would have had to rent a room for the night.</p>
    <p>
Finally, we arrived back home close to 2:30AM the next morning. I vaguely remember stepping into the shower, but I must have sleep-showered because the next thing I knew I was in bed fast asleep. And with that, my first east coast mountain trip was conquered.</p>
    <p><u>Reflection</u></p>
    <p>This was the least prepared I have been for any trip, and it is directly related to the lack of mental clarity I had going into packing the morning of trip departure. I believe my physical capabilities were sufficient for the climb, but I need to do a better job of being mindful of how much water I will need, where I will restock my supply if I need to, and how to better ration water for the duration of the hike. Also important, I need to make sure I or someone I am traveling with has a first aid kit. The last major faux pas was not bringing a rain coat. The mistakes I made were pretty frustrating mistakes to make because I know if I had been in the right state of mind I wouldn't have had as much trouble.</p>
    <p>Disregarding discomfort I felt from a lack of preparation, I thoroughly enjoyed the climb. The temperature was comfortable and the rain wasn't too bad under the treeline. The views from the top, at least when there weren't clouds covering them, were fantastic and the landscape unique. Equally as great as the trail were the people I shared it with, both the party members and those we met along the way. The Sawmill bar has friendly and inviting staff and is operated by a down-to-earth guy. The food was amazing after a long day's hike, and I would happily return if I am in the area again.</p>
